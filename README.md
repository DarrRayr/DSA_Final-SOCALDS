getTopCandidates method Big O is O(n^2), Big Omega is O(n^2).
The time complexity of this method is O(n^2) because the nested loop in the sorting method using Tim sort iterates over all candidates for each score in average, whereas a good senario would result in Big Omega. But that doesn't matter because we have a nested loop that llops through 2 for loops making it quadratic time no matter what senario.
setSocials method Big O is O(1), Big Omega is O(1)
Loops through a method 3 times, evertime, makig every senario O(1).
